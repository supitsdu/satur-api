# Satur API

Satur is a personal web development mockup project I'm working on. The goal is to learn how to create efficient, secure and robust API using the next gen language Go.

## Dependencies

- Go >= 1.22
- Make >= 4.4.1

## Getting started

Run the following command to fetch or manage dependencies:

```sh
make deps
```

Execute the API:

```sh
make run
```
